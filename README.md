#Memory Game
Based on the master code provided by Udacity. 

##Instructions
To play, click a card to reveal the symbol on the other side. To make a match, click two cards with the same symbol. If you select two cards that don't match, they'll be hidden again. The goal is to match all cards in the deck. But don't just guess – the more times you click the worse your final score!
